# Foreign Language Summary

As far as I know, there are only a handful of instances where foreign language text is included.   I think we are on the same page that the general strategy should be to avoid all foreign language text and either just skip it, if there already a translation in the text, or replace it if said translation is missing.  I believe I have covered all such instances below.

## Series 3, Page 25.

## Please replace the Italian with the English translation below:

```
And he : “If I were made of leaded glass
Thine outward image I should not attract 
Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
```


## Series 3, Page 99-100.  Please skip over the Italian and read only the English translation that's already in the pdf.

Here there are two instances where we have the Italian first and then an English translation immediately following.  In both cases, please just ignore the Italian and only read the English.

## Series 3, Page 101.  Please skip over the Italian and read only the English translation.
