## Please replace the Italian with the English translation below:

```
And he : “If I were made of leaded glass
Thine outward image I should not attract 
Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
```


## Series 3, Page 99-100.  Please skip over the Italian and read only the English translation that's already in the pdf.

Here there are two instances where we have the Italian first and then an English translation immediately following.  In both cases, please just ignore the Italian and only read the English.
